# Mission Statement

**Our mission is to empower the world to communicate with context and insight.**

We believe the highest leverage way to do this is by creating tools
that accelerate integrating communications features directly into apps that
help people manage information for specific contexts, and by using our vantage
point as a platform to continue bringing our customers more powerful features
to get insight from their communications data. Email, contacts, and calendar
are just the start.
