# Responsible Vacation Policy

We all work hard, and we recognize that! In order to give our best and live a well-balanced life, we need to take time off to pursue interests outside of work, whether that means sitting on a beach or climbing a mountain. At Superformula, we believe you should take responsibility for managing your own time, communication, and collaboration with your team. To that end, we’ve adopted a responsible vacation policy that gives each full-time employee the flexibility to take planned vacations as needed.

- Instead of accruing vacation time, you plan the vacation time you would like to take with your manager. You are responsible for officially requesting time off in Gusto so the whole team is aware of your absence. A courtesy OOO email to the team is super helpful, too!
- A consecutive ten-business-day vacation is mandatory every year after you’ve been with Superformula more than six months. Paid holidays are not included as paid vacation days. We know, it sounds hard to be out for that long, and we’ll miss you, but it’s in your best interest to unplug. This two-week vacation allows everyone to fully recharge, and it gives the company an opportunity to test its resiliency against any one person's absence.
- Managers evaluate vacation requests in light of business and group needs and other factors they deem relevant. Vacation time is generally approved on a first-come, first-serve basis, although particular circumstances may differ. Having several teammates out during the same week can be difficult, especially if there is a known critical deadline for a project on which a vacationing teammate plays a key role.
- In your first 90 days at the company, you should make your best effort to not take an extended vacation. We’ve found that this ramp-up period to be particularly critical for new members of our team to become effective.
- Time off lasting more than one week should be pre-approved by your manager at least one month in advance. More broadly, for each week you want to take off, you should give your manager one month of notice—two months for two weeks, three months for three weeks, etc. As always, planning time off in advance helps your team prepare for your absence. We encourage you to schedule for times that won’t cause significant disruption to team operations.
- Since employees don't “accrue” vacation days under this policy, you will not receive compensation for “unused” vacation time if/when you leave Superformula.
- You continue to have full Superformula benefits through vacation periods, and your equity will continue to vest to the fullest extent permitted by governing plans and agreements.
- Time off due to short-term and long-term illness and/or injury or leaves of absence, such as those covered under our caregiver policy or sick day program, are handled separately. Vacation under this policy cannot be used for those types of absences or any other leave. Please refer to the specific policies in this handbook or contact HR if you have questions about them.
- Vacation under this policy is intended to build trust, one of our core values, in working relationships. Superformula expects that employees will use good judgment, take time off in appropriate amounts, and coordinate with their managers in advance, while completing their workloads. If an employee’s performance declines due to abuse of this policy, Superformula reserves the right to review the employee’s use of this policy and determine if discipline or termination is appropriate.
