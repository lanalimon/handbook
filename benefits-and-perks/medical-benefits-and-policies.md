# Medical Benefits and Policies

## Medical, Vision, and Dental Insurance

Superformula provides competitive medical, vision, and dental benefits for all full-time staff members (40 hours) and their families.

## Workers' Comp

We provide workers’ compensation insurance for qualifying injuries “on the job” for partial loss of wages and medical expenses, for employees on Superformula payroll. We don't determine what qualifies—the insurer does, based on state regulations. Please report any injuries to Margaret as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours after an accident or injury has occurred, in order to meet the requirements of our insurer, The Hartford. General information about workers’ compensation in California can be found [here](http://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/dwc_home_page.htm).

## State Disability

Staff members who become disabled and unable to perform the functions of their job may be eligible to apply for State Disability Insurance to receive partial income. This income will be coordinated with eligible Superformula benefits including STD, LTD, and PTO. More information on California STD can be found on the Employment Development Department’s [website](http://www.edd.ca.gov/Disability/).
