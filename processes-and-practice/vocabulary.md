# Vocabulary

Welcome to Superformula! Here’s a list of useful terms we use within the company. 📚

## General
- **LOL**—a Spang-ism that denotes amusement.
- **Grok**—to understand profoundly and intuitively (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok).
- **IIRC**—if I recall correctly.
- **OOO**—out of office.
- **PTO**—paid time off.
- **Retrospective**—where we talk about whats working well and poorly across teams and the company.
- **RGR**—“Roger”; yes.
- **SGTM**—sounds good to me.
- **Standup**—a daily meeting where everyone answers what they did yesterday, what they are doing today, and what blocks them.
- **TL;DR**—too long; didn’t read. Usually used as a request for summary (i.e., “What’s the TL;DR on this meeting?”).
- **WFH**—working from home.

## Engineering
- **API**—an application programming interface, or a protocol that allows different pieces of software to interact. In our case, we build a web service that allows other developers to make certain requests to our systems to perform certain actions (i.e., sending an email on behalf of a user).
- **Branch**—a copy of the codebase. It usually contains a person’s changes (a feature, a bug fix, etc.). There are many branches on each project, but the primary branch is “master”—the working codebase from which everyone else creates new branches and later merges in their changes. There’s also the “production” branch, which contains the code that gets deployed to our users.
- **cURL**—a method of making HTTP requests to access our APIs.
- **AEM**-Adobe Experience Mananger. MGM's current-generation content management system
- **Diff**—a differential, or the changes between the current codebase that everyone shares and the code that someone has written. We “submit” diffs to others to review our code, and then we “land” them onto the primary codebase, which makes our changes available to everyone else.
- **Endpoint**—a URL where a service can be accessed. For instance, our `/messages` endpoint for the Superformula API can be accessed at https://api.Superformula.com/messages.
- **Kickoff**—a meeting at the start of the week to look at Phab tasks, assign them to different engineers, and check on the progress of current projects.
- **On-call**—a rotating role on the engineering team to address emergencies and urgent customer-facing issues. Engineers take a cycling week-long shift to be the go-to person responsible for handling incidents (i.e., if the API is down).
- **Performant**—efficient. A performant solution to a problem is optimal in terms of speed.
- **Refactor**—to rewrite and restructure old code in a way that works better.
- **Regression**—an old bug or issue that returns inadvertently after an update to the codebase.
- **SDK**—software development kit, or a wrapper around the APIs. An SDK makes it easier for developers to integrate with the APIs since it allows them to use their language of choice instead of having to make raw HTTP or cURL requests to our endpoints.
- **Shipping**—releasing a feature or a bug fix to our customers.
- **Sprint**—a unit of time for which engineering work is allocated. Usually one or two weeks.

## Marketing
- **CMS**—content management system, or software that typically hosts a blog or a website (i.e., Hubspot, WordPress, Drupal).
- **Headless**-A completely structured content-based content management system
- **CRM**—customer relationship management system, or software that allows the sales and marketing teams track revenue and manage customer relationships from deal stage to contract size to projected revenue for the year (i.e., Salesforce).
